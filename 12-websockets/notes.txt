Web sockets 
1. Web sockets are full duplex communication protocol. These means that the party or Client or server can send and receive the message at the same time 
2. Where as HTTP is a protocol which is half duplex, which means that a party can either send the message or it is waiting for the message. In http when the client send the request the server is waiting for the request and when the server send the response the client is waiting for the request. 
3. Websockets work on the port number 80 and 443. These are the web ports and we do not right to make new ports and use this ports only because some of the firewalls block the non web ports.
